*Comrade, have you read the news lately? Our nation is threatened by capitalist pigs. The pigs have somehow convinced the 
humans to spread their ideologies to our kingdom, and we must act together to maintain our way of life.*

RPR is a game about pigeons doing their business at important events and on important murals. 

It's a simple hot-or-cold game where you are presented with some rough description of locations from news clippings and then you fly off in search of the places mentioned in the article. We'd originally wanted to focus on interesting geographical features, 
maybe reference old locations, but by the time we got the core gameplay written and the core day/night cycle gameplay going, it was a *mad rush* for content and the content is really what could have made this more fun. 

Still! It was one of our early projects in Godot, our first time working with an amazing animator, and I'm pretty happy with 
the result. It's very rough, not very fun, and needs a massive content overhaul, but it's not shabby for 48 hours or so.
